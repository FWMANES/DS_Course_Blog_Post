#### 2. Project Motivation

This project should answer the following questions regarding the Airbnb Seattle data:

Business Understanding and Data Understanding are done in parallel. Then follows the Data Preparation as a prerequisite of training a linear model to predict the prices in Seattle. At least the Results of the Linear Model is evaluated with a test set of the data.
